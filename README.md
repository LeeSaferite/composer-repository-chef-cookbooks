Composer Repository for Chef Cookbooks
======================================

Generated from the opscode-cookbooks organisation using the github api.

Usage example:

    {
        "minimum-stability": "dev",
        "require": {
            "opscode-cookbooks/apache2": "1.1.*"
        }
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "composer",
                "url": "https://raw.github.com/dancras/composer-repository-chef-cookbooks/master"
            }
        ]
    }

Dev stability is required for the composer cookbook installer and will be fixed soon.
